Fork of [rrd4j](https://github.com/rrd4j/rrd4j) with patches for:

* https://github.com/rrd4j/rrd4j/issues/8
* https://github.com/rrd4j/rrd4j/issues/48 (fixed)
* https://github.com/rrd4j/rrd4j/issues/49 (fixed)
* https://github.com/rrd4j/rrd4j/issues/50
* https://github.com/rrd4j/rrd4j/issues/51 (fixed)
* https://github.com/rrd4j/rrd4j/issues/64

Tickets marked as `(fixed)` are already merged into the main project.

When I get time I'll try to cleanup and get the important changes into the main project. Right
now the tests don't run, I think due to multi-y changes.
